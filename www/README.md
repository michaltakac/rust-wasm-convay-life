# `create-wasm-app`

> An `npm init` template for kick starting a project that uses NPM packages
> containing Rust-generated WebAssembly and bundles them with Webpack.

This template is designed for depending on NPM packages that contain
Rust-generated WebAssembly and using them to create a Website.

* Want to create an NPM package with Rust and WebAssembly? [Check out
  `wasm-pack-template`.](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack-template)
* Want to make a monorepo-style Website without publishing to NPM? Check out
  [`rust-webpack-template`](https://github.com/rustwasm/rust-webpack-template)
  and/or
  [`rust-parcel-template`](https://github.com/rustwasm/rust-parcel-template).

npm init wasm-app
